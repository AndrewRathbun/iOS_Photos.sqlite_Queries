# iOS_Photos.sqlite_Queries
iOS Photos.sqlite queries that may help with decoding data stored in `Photos.sqlite`. These queries are based on testing, research and some community published research. These queries were written to work for the Photos.sqlite database stored at: 

iOS: `/private/var/mobile/media/PhotoData/Photos.Sqlite`

Mac OS: `/Users//Pictures/PhotosLibrary.photoslibrary/database/Photos.sqlite`

My research started in 2020 and since that time, I have continued to research and update the queries. The initial write up was posted via [Heather Mahalikâ€™s blog](https://smarterforensics.com/). The write up was later reviewed and publised by DFRWS [here](https://dfir.pubpub.org/pub/v19rksyf/release/1).

A follow-up blog was posted on 2021/11/23 and can be found [here](https://theforensicscooter.com/2021/11/23/photos-sqlite-queries/). 

Blog update posted 2022/02/21 and can be found [here](https://theforensicscooter.com/2022/02/21/photos-sqlite-update-3/). 

2022/03/26 Some queries were deleted in preparation of updates.
